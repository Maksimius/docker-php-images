# Project Overview for LLMs

This project is a collection of Dockerfiles for PHP development environments.

The primary purpose is to maintain a centralized set of Docker images that can be reused across different projects.

It includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/docker-build-push.yml`) that automates the following process on every push to the `main` branch:
1.  **Builds multi-architecture Docker images** (`linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`) for each service defined in the subdirectories (`php8.4-fpm`, `php8.4-fpm-xdebug`).
2.  **Pushes the images** to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).
3.  **Tags the images** with `latest`.
4.  **Cleans up the registry** by removing all tags for the images that are not `latest`.

Key technologies: Docker, GitHub Actions, PHP.
